# Resolution-insensitive hub cost (VR-125)

Branch codex/vr-125-resolution-floor continues from the archived VR-121
instrumentation branch to preserve source/PDB identity. It does not change
rendering. Installed DLL remains298-g3d80740a9 at2750x2850. Previous branch
and original main base18ae4ebda remain recoverable.

## Evidence and hypothesis

75% fewer pixels improved mean logged throughput only about6%, not literally
zero. Separate runs are not a controlled ABA. Nearly twice the original pixels
caused44-49 ticks/s in consecutive windows, but later workload changed. See
NATIVE_DRAW_PROFILE.md for exact provenance. GPU timestamps already existed;
their elapsed spans include GPU idle gaps and do not establish saturation.

## Next capture

Use Windows Performance Recorder GeneralProfile plus GPU, memory mode, at the
original resolution. CPU sampled stacks and scheduling events identify which
threads consume CPU or wait; GPU events show queue activity and submission.
No network/file-content collection profile requested. Trace is system-wide
metadata, kept locally under ignored build/performance-results, never published.
Check recording start succeeded before asking for a run. Administrative elevation
is required; first non-admin attempt returned0xc5585011. Never cancel another
recording; initial status confirmed no recording. Stop and save this recording
on the next user report, including early abort. Preserve matching DLL/PDB and
both game logs. Do not leave a trace running after completion.

One test: same hub view120Hz, weapons out, stand still60 seconds without menus
or combat, briefly move head/hands, exit and report. Question: did the usual hub
lag remain representative? A representative run permits attribution; materially
changed behavior means profiling perturbation/workload confounds the result.

## Analysis and decision

Filter Dishonored PID and the steady gameplay interval. Inspect CPU sampling
by thread/module/stack; resolve proxy PDB locally, engine frames by module RVA.
Do not equate whole-process CPU percentage with one-thread saturation. Inspect
context switches, ready time and wait stacks alongside GPU queues and Present.
Compare engine, proxy, graphics driver and runtime ownership. Check lost events
and usable stacks before drawing conclusions. CPU samples alone cannot explain
blocked time; GPU spans alone cannot distinguish feeding gaps from execution.
If engine work dominates, find a repeated expensive path before editing. If
waits dominate, identify the waited-on owner and why. If GPU work dominates,
identify resolution-independent geometry/shadow cost and compare resolution
experiments. No speculative synchronization removal, AER rewrite or upscaler.
Select one bounded change only when this evidence identifies a meaningful cost.

## Automated launch recovery and initial run

Current user explicitly authorized agent game launches for this investigation,
superseding the earlier no-launch rule. No merge permission. The simulator is
now usable through Steam with an explicit local control directory. Direct launch
crashed shortly after startup; dump and logs retained, cause not proven.

Standalone selftest initially failed xrCreateInstance -32 because of an enabled
incompatible OpenXR capture layer. A manifest-declared process-local opt-out
allowed60 frames with zero errors. xrsim-selftest now accepts
-DisableLayerEnvironment, restores prior values in finally, and does not change
registry registration. Read the installed layer manifest for its opt-out name.

The simulator selected the LAST adapter tied for largest reported VRAM because
its comparator used >=. This machine enumerates duplicate same-name adapters;
D3D9 and real runtime use the first, simulator picked the second. Changed ties
to retain the first and log the final choice. Verified selftest selected the
same LUID as D3D9; Steam game run changed from sync fallback to shared capture,
and previously failed compositor eye captures succeeded. Not a headset fix.

Launch commands: xrsim-selftest -Release with manifest-derived layer opt-out;
xrsim-launch -Release -AllowStale -ViaSteam -Dir <repo>/build/vr125-sim.
AllowStale deliberately retains the exact validated298-g3d80740a9 game DLL;
only simulator code changed. Set DVR_DATA_DIR to installed Paths.DataDir for
mod commands, and always pass identical explicit -Dir to simulator tools.
Use refresh120; inspect capture between each Return (title, Continue, loading
confirmation). Hound Pits loaded. Gradual head to0 1.6 0 180 0 0 3000 turned
successfully; instant180-degree changes did not establish a reliable orientation.
Screenshots in ignored build/vr125-sim document the views. No save edits.

55.039s process-thread CPU accounting: busiest threads75.94%,71.23%,38.27%
of one logical core. Thread ownership is unclassified, no stack evidence yet.
Open courtyard view roughly89-90 logged ticks/s versus62-66/s headset workload;
not a matched comparison. Runtime/streaming/FOV and exact view differ. Do not
claim a performance improvement or identify a bottleneck from this run.
Next: match the exact heavy view and identify thread owners/active stacks or
CPU-vs-wall spans without elevation. ETW still requires Windows elevation.
Game closed after capture. Full installed INI byte-identical to pre-launch;
DLL hash unchanged. Evidence: build/performance-results/vr125-sim-working,
vr125-direct-crash, vr125-wrong-adapter. No pending test for the user.
