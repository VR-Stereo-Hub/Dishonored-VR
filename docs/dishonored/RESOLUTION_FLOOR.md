# Resolution-insensitive hub cost (VR-125)

Branch codex/vr-125-resolution-floor continues from the archived VR-121
instrumentation branch to preserve source/PDB identity. It does not change
rendering. Installed DLL remains298-g3d80740a9 at2750x2850. Previous branch
and original main base18ae4ebda remain recoverable.

## Evidence and hypothesis

75% fewer pixels improved mean logged throughput only about6%, not literally
zero. Separate runs are not a controlled ABA. Nearly twice the original pixels
caused44-49 ticks/s in consecutive windows, but later workload changed. See
NATIVE_DRAW_PROFILE.md for exact provenance. GPU timestamps already existed;
their elapsed spans include GPU idle gaps and do not establish saturation.

## Next capture

Use Windows Performance Recorder GeneralProfile plus GPU, memory mode, at the
original resolution. CPU sampled stacks and scheduling events identify which
threads consume CPU or wait; GPU events show queue activity and submission.
No network/file-content collection profile requested. Trace is system-wide
metadata, kept locally under ignored build/performance-results, never published.
Check recording start succeeded before asking for a run. Administrative elevation
is required; first non-admin attempt returned0xc5585011. Never cancel another
recording; initial status confirmed no recording. Stop and save this recording
on the next user report, including early abort. Preserve matching DLL/PDB and
both game logs. Do not leave a trace running after completion.

One test: same hub view120Hz, weapons out, stand still60 seconds without menus
or combat, briefly move head/hands, exit and report. Question: did the usual hub
lag remain representative? A representative run permits attribution; materially
changed behavior means profiling perturbation/workload confounds the result.

## Analysis and decision

Filter Dishonored PID and the steady gameplay interval. Inspect CPU sampling
by thread/module/stack; resolve proxy PDB locally, engine frames by module RVA.
Do not equate whole-process CPU percentage with one-thread saturation. Inspect
context switches, ready time and wait stacks alongside GPU queues and Present.
Compare engine, proxy, graphics driver and runtime ownership. Check lost events
and usable stacks before drawing conclusions. CPU samples alone cannot explain
blocked time; GPU spans alone cannot distinguish feeding gaps from execution.
If engine work dominates, find a repeated expensive path before editing. If
waits dominate, identify the waited-on owner and why. If GPU work dominates,
identify resolution-independent geometry/shadow cost and compare resolution
experiments. No speculative synchronization removal, AER rewrite or upscaler.
Select one bounded change only when this evidence identifies a meaningful cost.
