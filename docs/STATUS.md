# Status

## Current state (2026-09-02, session 1 of the continuation)

The original mod (GingasVR, public release = proxy build 38.92 + DXVK fork M8.2) is
**shipped and unchanged in behavior**; this session turned its one 23k-line file into a
development framework:

- **Builds with VS2022 / CMake** (win32 preset, static CRT, C++20) instead of a MinGW
  cross-compile from Linux. `d3d9.dll` exports exactly the nine undecorated names
  (`tools\exports-check.ps1`); Debug and Release both build; `DVR_WITH_LEGACY` ON and OFF both
  build. Version 40.0.0 (the author's private line already reached 39.4).
- **Module tree** under `src/proxy`, `src/core`, `src/game/dishonored`, `src/legacy`, produced by
  `tools/split-source.py` with every function body verbatim (`--check` proves it against commit
  48766c07). Still ONE translation unit (`src/mod/dishonoredvr.cpp`) with the original globals
  in `src/mod/state/`; the utilities (log, crash, clock, mem, ini, paths, hooks, command seam,
  status) are real modules with headers. See ARCHITECTURE "The unity build".
- **DXVK fork restored in-repo** under `dxvk/` from this repo's own history: DXVK 3.0.2 +
  the 52 patches as commits (tags `dxvk-base`, `dxvk-m8.2-shipped`, `dxvk-m8.4`,
  `dxvk-shipped` = M8.2 + M8.4 reverted, matching what proxy 38.92 targets). Not built yet on
  this PC (needs meson, ninja, glslangValidator; `tools\build-dxvk.ps1` is written but unrun).
- **Logging/debugging**: leveled, tagged log with ring buffer and `.prev.log` rotation; crash
  fingerprint + minidumps; `command.txt` seam with ack; `status.json`; frame/eye/HUD dumps; F10
  overlay Log tab; `[game] state:` transition line.
- **Backend probe** replaces the process-snapshot auto-detect (Quest over Link/Air Link/Steam
  Link fell through to OpenVR before).
- **Simulator** (`dvr_xrsim32.dll`, Quest-3-shaped 32-bit OpenXR runtime) builds and passes
  `tools\xrsim-selftest.ps1` on this PC (60 frames, FOCUSED, 0 errors).
- **Harness** copied and adapted from the BioShock trilogy mod: build/install/uninstall/package,
  launch/boot/game-cmd/key/click/shot/batch, xrsim-*, img-diff, soak, eye-check, exports and
  lint checks, log-parse, status-dump, setup-game-ini.
- **Docs** written: this file, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, RESEARCH, VERIFICATION, CODE_REVIEW,
  KNOWN_ISSUES, TROUBLESHOOTING, RELEASE_NOTES, dishonored/ENGINE_NOTES, TESTING, XR_HANDOFF,
  CLAUDE.md, and the author's own handoff (`docs/dishonored/HANDOFF-GINGASVR.md`).

**What "ported" means today.** Every function of the original file is in the new tree,
grouped by subsystem, bodies unchanged, and it builds as one program. The internals are only
partly converted to real modules: the ~1,500 original globals still sit in `src/mod/state`
and most modules cannot compile alone. Nothing was dropped.

**The author's handoff changes the picture in three ways** (HANDOFF-GINGASVR.md):

1. Their private builds 39.0-39.4 (rebased onto 38.72, the last owner-confirmed-good
   build) carry fixes our 38.92 base lacks: calibration records banked by asset name
   (39.0, "wiggling weapons"), a closed loop on the pitch write that lets the fallback
   engage when the engine discards it (39.2), **the D3D11 device created on the adapter the
   OpenXR runtime asks for** (39.3; our tree still passes `NULL` and
   `D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_SHARED`, `src/core/gfx/d3d11_device.cpp`), and the uncovered
   menu-ghost quadrant (39.4). Their 39.x line LACKS the 38.78 focus keep-alive fix, which
   our 38.92 base has.
2. 38.73-38.92 stacked unverified changes (the chain-stamp / StampLive / StampFix
   series); the author considers 38.72 the good base. D1 parity must therefore compare our
   build against 38.72-era behavior plus the 39.x fixes, not against 38.92 alone.
3. The best current explanation for "works only on his PC" (the Quest zoom / no-pitch bug) is
   the dual-GPU adapter mismatch, never confirmed by an affected user; GPU vendor/model/driver
   was never collected from one.

**The game is NOT installed on the dev PC.** Nothing here has run inside Dishonored. The
refactored DLL is build-verified, export-verified and body-verified only.

## Next steps (the plan)

> **Session 2 changed the priority.** The freeze-then-rescale in gameplay is now the top
> item, ahead of the port list below. The resolution, FOV, adapter and mono/stereo-UV
> causes have all been eliminated by measurement.
>
> **Session 3 corrected session 2's suspect.** The exit crash is an EXECUTE fault (a call
> through a freed code pointer), not a freed-memory write, and the faulting thread is NOT
> the pace thread - both errors were instrument bugs, not engine facts (ENGINE_NOTES,
> "reading the fingerprint correctly"). The next lead is the `CopyResource` size mismatch
> in the publish path, item 0 below. Uncommitted work from sessions 2 and 3 is in the
> working tree (22 files); nothing was pushed.


The port finishes opportunistically; the headset work comes first.

0. **The freeze, next three moves** (session 3; none of them need a headset to write):
   a. **`CopyResource` size mismatch in the publish path.** `g_eyeTex` is sized by
      `EnsurePipeline`, which latches on `g_pipelineReady`; `g_xrpTex` and the swapchains
      are sized from `g_xrEyeW/H`, re-read on **every** bring-up attempt
      (`XrRtTryInit` retries 10 times, 5 s apart). If an attempt gets past
      `EnsurePipeline` and then fails at `xrCreateSession`, the next attempt can come back
      at a different recommended size, and `XrRtPublish`'s
      `CopyResource(g_xrpTex, g_eyeTex)` becomes a **permanent silent no-op** - a frozen
      headset image with every call returning success. Log both sizes at publish and
      refuse the mismatch loudly; recreate `g_xrpTex` when `g_xrEyeW/H` move.
   b. ~~**`xrWaitSwapchainImage` timeout is treated as success.**~~ DONE (session 3).
   c. ~~**Nothing joins the pace thread.**~~ DONE (session 3). `xrRequestExitSession` /
      `xrEndSession` / `xrDestroySession` are still never called - deliberately left for a
      separate change, since it needs the pace loop's cooperation and rule 1 of the
      handoff's process rules is one behavioural change per build.

1. **Sources from the author.** Ask GingasVR for `dllmain_38.72.cpp`, `dllmain_39.4.cpp` and
   the fork's p53 commit (`45116f2f`, `dxvk_vr_view`) from `G:\back\Dishonored vr\out\`. Diff
   38.72 vs 38.92 (what the rebase dropped) and 38.92 vs 39.4 (what to port). Without them,
   port from the handoff's descriptions.
2. **Port the 39.x fixes onto our tree**, one behavioral change per commit, in this order:
   39.3 adapter LUID (also fixes CODE_REVIEW 28), 39.4 menu quadrant, 39.2 pitch closed loop,
   39.0 calibration bank. Keep the 38.78 keep-alive.
3. **D1 parity with the game installed** (SteamVR lane): `setup-game-ini.ps1 -Resolution`,
   `install.ps1 -SkipDxvk` with the shipped fork, boot, compare the log against a 38.72/39.4
   log from the author's rig. Then the simulator lane: `xrsim-launch.ps1`, `boot.ps1
   -Attach`, `smoke.xrs`, `stereo.xrs`. Note the handoff's trap: a direct exe launch crashes
   at the menu, so the sim launcher must go through Steam with `[VR] XrRuntimeJson` and
   `[VR] Backend=openxr` written to the ini instead of env vars (VERIFICATION gotcha 12).
4. **Get an affected Quest user on a 39.3+-equivalent build** and read the adapter lines in
   their log; collect GPU vendor/model/driver. This is the highest-value single test.
5. **`IVrBackend`** (the Quest work depends on it), then the config table, then the
   remaining modules as they are touched (ARCHITECTURE "how a module leaves the unity build").
6. Port the process rules into practice: one behavioral change per build; diff against the
   last good build first; the packaged ini is a byte copy of the tested machine's ini.

## Blockers

- The 38.72 / 39.4 sources and the p53 fork commit live only in the author's archive.
- **The freeze-then-rescale in gameplay is NOT fixed** (session 2). It survives the
  resolution fix, the FOV fix and the mono/stereo UV rebuild fix. This is the one to
  chase next; see the session 2 log for what has been ruled out, and the session 3 log
  for which of session 2's leads turned out to be instrument bugs.
- **No headset-run log survives.** Rotation is one deep and two simulator runs overwrote
  both. The next headset run must have its `dishonored_vr.log` copied out before anything
  else launches, or the same evidence is lost again.
- Both blockers below were cleared on William's PC in session 2 and remain true only for
  the other dev PC: the game IS installed, and the DXVK toolchain IS present, so the fork
  and the proxy both build there.

## Session log

### 2026-09-02 - session 4d: the lever is half of the resolution setting

**The 3840x2160 run was full-frame but letterboxed** - tester: "almost sort of right again,
only problem was that the resolution was rectangular so it didn't fill my view". Both halves
of that are now explained, and one of them was my error.

**My error.** Session 4's restore set `FovLever=100`, correct for the near-square 2850x2750
it was paired with. Session 4c then changed the render to 16:9 and left the lever at 100.
The frustum-fill branch takes its vertical extent as `tan(fovDeg/2)/aspect`, so at 16:9 with
lever 100 the quad clamps to **67.7 deg inside a 99 deg frustum** - letterboxed by
construction. At lever 130 the same 16:9 render fills edge to edge with ~9% black at the
bottom. Changing the render aspect without changing the lever is NOT a one-variable change:
the pair is the variable. Table in ENGINE_NOTES, "FovLever IS the vertical fill lever".

**The requested resolution is not being honoured at all.** The mod asked for 3840x2160; the
log says `capture: 2560x1440`. With `PinBackbuffer=0` that is harmless - buffer and content
agree, no crop, which is why 4c's fix worked - but **this rig cannot render above 2560x1440**
(desktop 5120x1440 caps it). Every "4032x2268" run here is really 2560x1440. Trust the
logged `capture:` number, never the requested one.

**F10 SAVE AS DEFAULTS was finally pressed** (the thing session 3c said had never happened).
The tester's tuning is now persisted and snapshotted to
`tests/golden/f10-tuned-2026-09-02.ini` and `<game>\...\dishonored_vr.ini.f10-saved-0247`:

| key | default | tuned |
|---|---|---|
| `[Tracking] HeightOffsetM` | 0.000 | 0.040 |
| `[Screen] FillScale` | 1.00 | **0.74** |
| `[Screen] DistanceMeters` | 1.60 | 1.67 |
| `[PosTrack] Scale` | 50.0 | **100.0** |
| `CrouchToggle` | 1 | 0 |
| `XrLayer` | (absent) | proj |
| `StampFix` | (absent) | 0 |

`[PosTrack] Scale=100.0` matches the measured 100 uu/m from commit 60235b86 - the tester
converged on the measured value by feel, which is a good cross-check on that measurement.

**Applied on request: GingasVR's resolution default**, as the coherent pair -
`RenderWidth/Height=4032x2268`, `SpoofDesktopW/H=4096x2304`, **`FovLever=130`** - plus
`DishonoredEngine.ini` and all four AppCompat buckets at 4032x2268. `PinBackbuffer` stays 0
(her ini has no such key) and `MenuFillScale` stays 1.00 (the 4b fix). Every F10 value above
is preserved. Backups `.pre-gingasres` / `.f10-saved-0247`. NOT YET TESTED.

**Expect this**: the render will probably clamp to 2560x1440 again (fine, still 16:9), and at
lever 130 the quad should fill horizontally and to the top with ~9% black at the bottom -
**but `FillScale=0.74` will still present it at 74% of that**. F2 raises FillScale live in
the headset; that single knob is the difference between 74% and full. Judge the lever first,
then the fill.

### 2026-09-02 - session 4c: THE RENDER WAS NEVER 2850x2750

**This is the root cause.** The tester sent a desktop-mirror screenshot of the main menu with
the picture in the top-left of the window. The mirror blits the backbuffer's LEFT HALF
pillarboxed (`frame_hooks.cpp:415-460`), so its horizontal placement is expected - but the
picture filled only the top ~52% of the window, and that is not.

**Measured, six capture dumps, non-black bounding box:**

| requested buffer | actual content | real display mode? | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1600x900 | 1600x900 | yes | FULL |
| 2560x1440 | 2560x1440 | yes | FULL |
| 3840x2160 | 3840x2160 | yes | FULL |
| 4032x2268 (GingasVR's) | 3024x1440 | no | CROPPED |
| 2750x2850 | 2750x2200 | no | CROPPED |
| **2850x2750 (our "known good")** | **2560x1440** | no | **CROPPED** |

At 2850x2750 the game draws exactly **2560x1440 into the top-left** and leaves the rest
black. So the whole session's geometry was applied to a frame that is half empty. It
explains all three symptoms at once: tiny (content covers ~90% x 52% of the quad), top-left
(it is literally there), and the eyes not fusing (the SBS halves meet at x=1280, not the
x=1425 the split assumes, so each eye gets part of the other's view plus black).

**Why nothing caught it.** `PinBackbuffer=1` forces the DEVICE to 2850x2750 while the game
renders at the size it asked for (`CreateDevice the game asked for 2560x1440`). The mod then
spoofs `GetClientRect` to 2850x2750 and the setres path reads that spoof back, concluding
`setres: the game is already at 2850x2750 - skipping the resolution script entirely`. A
check reading our own spoof cannot fail its own hypothesis, so the engine-side resize never
ran and `capture: 2850x2750` was logged for a half-empty frame.

**`PinBackbuffer` is ours, not GingasVR's.** Her tuned ini (`.pre-2750`) has no such line.
Every ini since session 2 sets it to 1.

**This is probably the central open bug.** 4032x2268 is not a standard mode either and
cropped here too. Whether an injected mode is honoured depends on the machine's GPU, driver
and desktop mode - this rig's desktop is 5120x1440, and two of the three cropped captures
came back exactly 1440 tall. It predicts affected users have a desktop shorter than the
requested render height, and it is falsifiable by asking one for their desktop resolution.

**The Documents folder was ruled out**, on the tester's suggestion: `DishonoredEngine.ini` is
vanilla plus the intended VR lines, all four AppCompat buckets were already correct, and no
file in the Config directory contains 2560 or 1440.

**Applied for testing** (one coherent change: use a resolution the display actually offers):
`RenderWidth/Height 2850x2750 -> 3840x2160`, `SpoofDesktopW/H -> 3840x2160`,
`PinBackbuffer 1 -> 0`, plus `DishonoredEngine.ini` and all four `[AppCompatBucket1..4]` to
3840x2160. Per-eye half 1920x2160 = aspect 0.889, the same per-eye aspect as GingasVR's
4032x2268. Backups: `.pre-realmode` next to each of the three files. NOT YET TESTED.
Fallback if 3840x2160 is not honoured: 2560x1440, identical per-eye aspect, and the game
asked for it itself.

**Also confirmed this session**: the 4b MenuFillScale fix works. The 02:35 run logged 28 quad
rebuilds, all at `fill=1.00` / 100.0 x 98.0 deg, none at 0.60. The size pumping is gone.

**Next instrument to build**: nothing compares the captured frame's real content extent to
the buffer size. A non-black bounding-box check on the capture, logged once per resolution
change, turns this class of bug into one line. The setres check must also stop reading the
mod's own `GetClientRect` spoof.

### 2026-09-02 - session 4b: the world size PUMPS, and MenuFillScale is why

A headset run on the restored known-good ini (02:23, VirtualDesktopXR + Quest 3) reported
"still rendering tiny and in the top left corner". Its log names the cause outright, so this
did not need a new instrument. Full derivation in ENGINE_NOTES, "MenuFillScale pumps the
world size during GAMEPLAY".

**The number.** The quad subtends **71.1 x 69.2 deg** inside a frustum of **94.0 x 99.0 deg**
- about half its solid angle. That is "tiny", fully explained, and nothing to do with
resolution, adapter, world scale or convergence. 40 of the run's 46 quad rebuilds were at
`fill=0.60`; the run ended there.

**The mechanism.** `MenuFillScale=0.60` and the `XrFrustumFill` gate are driven by the SAME
condition (`g_menuOpen || g_inMenu || g_sbsMonoNow`), and a change in it forces a rebuild.
The menu flag flaps during gameplay (the `Req_SaveSlotInfos` save-slot polls, already
documented at `present.cpp:613-616`), so the world size pumped 100 -> 71 -> 100 -> 71 -> 100
-> 71 deg across the six seconds before the crash, all after gameplay had started. The
`sbs:` line proves it is the MENU flag and not the splice counter: its last transition is
well before the pumping began.

**Why the Index never saw it.** OpenVR has one geometry path, so `MenuFillScale` only ever
dimmed a menu. `XrFrustumFill` (38.13) added a second path for the OpenXR port without making
the transition continuous, so on Quest the same flap swaps the whole quad construction
mid-gameplay. The tester's own read - Index/SteamVR was the tuned target, OpenXR/Quest a
later port - is exactly right here.

**Applied, config only, one variable, no rebuild**: `[Screen] MenuFillScale 0.60 -> 1.00`
(backup `.pre-menufill`). The menu branch now builds the same 100.0 x 98.0 deg quad as
gameplay, so a flap cannot change the world size. Cost: menu edges crop, which is what 32.4
added the key to avoid. NOT YET TESTED.

**A falsifiable prediction, and it contradicts session 3c.** Worked from the logged frustum,
the authored quad's vertical border must be SYMMETRIC, ~21% black top and ~21% bottom, with
the world in the middle 57.6%; horizontally the left eye gets 29.8% black on the temple side
and 5.6% on the nasal side (mirrored in the right eye - the rigid-screen design). Session 3c
recorded "top ~54%, bottom half black". The next `dump eyes` settles it: symmetric borders
retire that contradiction as a misread dump; a real black bottom half falsifies this model.

**The run also CRASHED** at 02:23:49, wild instruction pointer, minidump at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DishonoredVR\dumps\dvr_20260902_022349.dmp`. Untriaged, separate lane.

**Good news in the same log**: the fork's projection export resolved this time -
`quad/fill: world scale is set by the MEASURED render FOV (fork dxvk_vr_proj) = 100.0 deg`.
The landscape fix (session 3b) worked; world scale is no longer an assumed constant.

### 2026-09-02 - session 4: reverted to the known-good point

No launches, no code changes. Session 3c left the rig one key away from its own
confirmed-good configuration and that key was an open, unevaluated experiment; this
restores the documented point so the next run starts from a known baseline.

**What was actually different.** Exactly one line: `FovLever=130` vs `100`. Everything
else already matched - `RenderWidth/Height=2850x2750`, `SpoofDesktopW/H=2816x2880`,
`PinBackbuffer=1`, `GameFOVDeg=100`, `FillScale=1.00`, `[PosTrack] Scale=50.0`, the game
ini at 2850x2750 on both `[SystemSettings]` and `[SystemSettingsEditor]`, and all four
`[AppCompatBucket1..4]` at 2850x2750. `setup-game-ini.ps1` did not need re-running.

**The snapshot checks out.** `tests\golden\known-good-2850x2750-lever100.ini`, the game
folder's `dishonored_vr.ini.KNOWN-GOOD` and `dishonored_vr.ini.pre-lever130` (the ini as it
actually ran when the tester reported "the eyes seem to overlap correctly and provide
depth") are all identical. The snapshot is a truthful record of the run, not a
reconstruction - worth stating, because it was written at 00:54 while the live file was
already at `FovLever=130`.

**Restored** by byte copy, verified with `cmp` against both snapshots. Prior state saved as
`dishonored_vr.ini.pre-restore-known-good`.

**`FovLever=130` is untried, not disproved - and it was the well-motivated direction.**
ENGINE_NOTES "FovLever and the render size are ONE setting" has it the other way round from
how session 3c's ordering reads: at lever **100** the clamp limit is 1.91 m against a
frustum reaching 2.20 m horizontally and 2.29 m vertically, so it fires on **all four
sides**, and `dump eyes` at lever 100 confirmed the world inset with a ~9-10% border on
every side. At lever **130** the limit is 3.43 m, outside the frustum edge, so nothing
clamps and the quad fills the eye. 130 is also GingasVR's own tuned value.

**So the restore knowingly reinstates the bordered configuration.** That is the right call -
lever 100 at 2850x2750 is the only point a tester has ever confirmed fuses with depth, and
an unevaluated experiment is not a baseline - but the border is a KNOWN artifact of this
baseline, not a new symptom, and "the render window is halfway up my vision" must be judged
against that. Lever 130 stays queued as the next one-variable change once the gameplay dump
is in hand.

**Caveat that still stands**: no F10 tuning has ever been persisted (SAVE AS DEFAULTS was
never pressed), so this ini is the only reproducible configuration that exists.

**Untouched deliberately**: the proxy, the fork, `dxvk_stereo.txt`, and the stale
`command.txt` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DishonoredVR\` (`command.cpp:153` discards and clears a
command file older than the process, so the next run's log should show that branch firing -
a free check of the new seam diagnostics).

**Next**: unchanged from session 3c. Launch, reach GAMEPLAY with the window focused, then
`tools\game-cmd.ps1 "dump eyes"` and read the two PNGs. The unexplained contradiction is
still the lead: the world occupied only the top ~54% of the eye render target while the
measured frustum (55 deg down against 44 deg up) says the quad should overflow vertically.
That dump was a MENU frame and needs confirming in gameplay before anything is changed.

### 2026-09-02 - session 3c: the seam went deaf, and the eye texture is half black

**START HERE.** The bug is not fixed and the last measurement is incomplete.

**The one thing to do first**: launch, get into GAMEPLAY (not a menu, window focused),
then `tools\game-cmd.ps1 "dump eyes"` and look at the two PNGs in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DishonoredVR\dumps\`. Everything below is waiting on that image.

**The live symptom** (tester, Quest 3 + VirtualDesktopXR): eyes will not fuse, and the
image sits high - "the render window is halfway up my vision so I only see the bottom
half of it". Earlier in the session, "everything looked tiny".

**The measurement that matters.** A `dump eyes` caught mid-session shows the world
occupying only the **top ~54% of the eye render target, bottom half pure black**, in both
eyes. That is our own D3D11 pass, before the compositor. It was a MENU frame (the dump
caught a paused game), so it needs confirming in gameplay - but the vertical placement is
the lead. The measured frustum is
`eye frustums: L[-1.376 0.839 -1.428 0.966] ex=-0.0316 | R[-0.839 1.376 -1.428 0.966]`,
slots `[left, right, down, up]`: **down-biased, 55 deg down against 44 deg up**. Worked by
hand at these settings the quad should span y -2.36..+1.62 against a frustum of
-2.29..+1.55, i.e. it should OVERFLOW the eye vertically, not sit in the top half. That
contradiction is unexplained and is the next thing to chase.

Same dump showed the two eyes holding **different content** (different horizontal extents,
different fragments of the same menu text). That is the mono/stereo UV race on menu frames
- the fork stops splicing, the frame goes mono, each eye still takes its own half. Probably
menu-only: in gameplay the splice count is 5000+ and the halves are a real stereo pair.

**The command seam went deaf and blocked the session.** `status.json` stale for 18 minutes
and `command.txt` unread, while the Present hook ran at 62 fps with 251 `[present]` lines.
Two `dump eyes` commands did nothing and left no trace. `poll()` had FIVE silent returns,
so the failure was indistinguishable from the command never being written. **Fixed and
installed**: each guard now names itself with the path, the size and GetLastError. If the
seam is still deaf next session the log will say which branch refuses.

**Theories killed this session (do not re-run them):**

- The `CopyResource` size mismatch (step 0a) - eye RTs and XR eye size matched exactly.
- The pace thread as the crash victim - the faulting thread is `(other)`, not `xr-pace`.
- The black left eye - a SIMULATOR defect, not the mod; `dump eyes` shows the left eye
  texture full. See VERIFICATION "Known simulator defects".
- Eye cant - `g_eyeRot` is declared identity and the XR path correctly leaves it alone.
- The clock/rate gate - `MaimNowMs` is fine (the 5 s `depth:` line printed 50 times against
  the 3 s heartbeat's 81). Note the log uses `GetTickCount` while the gates use QPC via
  `dvr::clock`, so an advancing log proves NOTHING about the gate clock.
- A game restart clearing the seam - it did not.

**THE KNOWN-GOOD STATE, AND HOW TO GET BACK TO IT.** This rig's best result so far -
tester: *"the eyes seem to overlap correctly and provide depth, there is no freeze"* - came
from `2850x2750` + `FovLever=100` + `Scale=50`, with the main scene splicing (5202). It is
worth more than GingasVR's own values, which come from a different machine and are the
subject of the project's central open bug ("works only on her PC").

Snapshotted byte-for-byte in two places, so it survives a wiped game folder:

- `tests\golden\known-good-2850x2750-lever100.ini` (in the repo)
- `<game>\Binaries\Win32\dishonored_vr.ini.KNOWN-GOOD`

Restore = copy either over `<game>\Binaries\Win32\dishonored_vr.ini`, then
`tools\setup-game-ini.ps1 -Resolution -Width 2850 -Height 2750` for the game ini and the
four AppCompat buckets. The keys, if you ever need to rebuild it by hand:
`[Screen] RenderWidth=2850 RenderHeight=2750 SpoofDesktopW=2816 SpoofDesktopH=2880`
`PinBackbuffer=1 GameFOVDeg=100 FovLever=100 FillScale=1.00`, `[PosTrack] Scale=50.0`.

**WARNING - the snapshot does NOT contain any F10 tuning, and neither did any run.** The
overlay's sliders are live-only until someone presses **"SAVE AS DEFAULTS"**
(`overlay.cpp`, top of the panel), which calls `OverlaySaveDefaults` and writes ~90 keys -
world scale, fill, screen distance, height offset, menu fill, wrist HUD, and the whole hand
/ graft / blink block. It was never pressed, so every F10 adjustment the tester made across
this session was lost at process exit; the only thing that persisted was the hand
calibration, which `skelcontrol.cpp` writes on its own. **Procedure from now on: tune in
F10, press SAVE AS DEFAULTS, then re-snapshot the ini.** Otherwise a good configuration
cannot be reproduced, which is exactly what happened here.

**Config as left, LIVE right now**: ~~`FovLever=130`~~ **RESTORED to the known-good
snapshot (session 4)**. The live `dishonored_vr.ini` is now byte-identical to both
`tests\golden\known-good-2850x2750-lever100.ini` and the game folder's
`dishonored_vr.ini.KNOWN-GOOD` (`cmp` clean against both), i.e. `FovLever=100`. The
`FovLever=130` experiment was applied but never evaluated - the seam went deaf before a
dump could be taken - so it was discarded rather than judged; it remains untried, not
disproved. The pre-restore state is saved as `dishonored_vr.ini.pre-restore-known-good`.
Game ini + all 4 AppCompat buckets verified still at 2850x2750 (`DishonoredEngine.ini`
lines 1081/1141, `DishonoredCompat.ini` buckets 1-4), so no `setup-game-ini.ps1` re-run
was needed.
Backups in the game folder: `.pre-2750` (GingasVR's own tuned ini), `.pre-landscape`,
`.pre-scale100`, `.pre-gingas-restore`, `.pre-rollback`, `.pre-lever130`,
`.pre-restore-known-good`.

**Installed**: RelWithDebInfo proxy only, 00:50, carrying the seam diagnostics. The fork
(20:24) and `dxvk_stereo.txt` (13:52) are untouched and must stay that way - one variable.
Re-verified session 4: the installed `d3d9.dll` is md5-identical to
`build\src\RelWithDebInfo\d3d9.dll`, and the tree is clean at `112105b7`, so source,
build and install all agree. The fork and `dxvk_stereo.txt` timestamps are unchanged.

**Do not repeat these mistakes.** Restoring GingasVR's baseline I changed render size, FOV
lever and world scale in ONE step, so "misaligned" was unattributable; her values also come
from a different machine, and the project's central open bug is that her build works only
on her PC. This rig now has its own confirmed-good point (2850x2750, splices 5202, tester:
"eyes overlap correctly and provide depth") which is worth more than her numbers. Change
one thing per run, and get the gameplay dump before changing anything at all.

### 2026-09-01 - session 3b: the render was PORTRAIT, so there was no stereo

A headset run mid-session reported "the eyes are suuuuper far off and they both appear to
be zoomed in", worse than before. Its log is the **first surviving headset log** and is
archived outside the game folder. Cause found, fix applied, not yet tested.

**Session 2's resolution fix set the render to 2750x2850, which is portrait, and the DXVK
fork refuses to splice the main scene on a portrait viewport.** `d3d9_device.cpp:4381`
sets the refusal reason `"rt-portrait"`; the per-eye splice at `:4578` runs only when that
reason is `SPLICE`. So the world was drawn **mono** across the full frame while the proxy
handed each eye a different **half** of it - unrelated views that cannot fuse, each
magnified 2x by the stretch onto the quad. Exactly the report.

**The splice counter lies about it.** Light shafts, shadows and the M8.1 quarter light pass
splice under different conditions and kept working, so `splices=85` while the main scene
never spliced once - which kept `g_sbsMonoNow` false and the half-frame UVs on. The fork's
own log shows only effects splices.

**The same gate kills the FOV measurement.** `dxvk_vr_proj`'s publish (`:5996`) is also
gated on `Width > Height`, so `g_liveFovX` was 0 all session, the frustum-fill path fell
back silently to the ini constant `GameFOVDeg=100`, and an assumed number set world scale.

**This falsifies session 2's "the eyes ARE a stereo pair".** 32.7 mean-abs-diff static /
11.5 after a head turn is exactly what two different halves of one mono frame produce. That
test could not distinguish a stereo pair from two unrelated crops, so it could never have
failed its own hypothesis.

**Applied**: `2850x2750` - the same two numbers swapped. Same pixel cost, landscape by
100 px, full-frame aspect 1.036 so the quad subtends 100 x 98 deg at `FovLever=100`.
Changed in `tools/setup-game-ini.ps1` (defaults + a header section on why landscape is
mandatory), applied to `DishonoredEngine.ini` and `DishonoredCompat.ini` via the tool (both
backed up), and to the game folder's `dishonored_vr.ini` (backup `.pre-landscape`).

**Instruments added so this cannot hide again**: a portrait capture logs an Error naming
the fork's own refusal string and the fix (`present.cpp`); the frustum-fill path now says
every 10 s whether world scale comes from the MEASURED render FOV or from the assumed ini
constant (`eye_quads.cpp`).

**Installed**: RelWithDebInfo proxy only (`install.ps1 -Release -SkipDxvk`) - the fork and
`dxvk_stereo.txt` are untouched, so the resolution is the only render-path variable. The
proxy's other changes (session 3 below) are the shutdown/pace lane and logging, which
cannot confound the zoom result.

**Not yet tested.** If the fix worked the portrait Error is absent and the eyes fuse; if
the Error appears, the resolution did not take and AppCompat is overwriting it again.

### 2026-09-01 - session 3: the crash fingerprint was misread, and why

No launches: everything here comes from artifacts already on disk plus the source. The
game is installed on this PC, but nothing was run.

**Two of session 2's conclusions are instrument bugs, not engine facts.**

1. **The exit crash is an EXECUTE fault, not a freed-memory write.**
   `ExceptionInformation[0]` is three-valued (0 read, 1 write, 8 execute/DEP) and the
   fingerprinter tested it for truth, so every execute fault has printed as "writing". The
   records prove it: `ExceptionAddress == ExceptionInformation[1] == 0xDEDEDEDE` with the
   module resolving to `?`. A data write would have left `ExceptionAddress` inside
   `d3d11.dll`. **EIP landed in freed memory: a call through a poisoned code pointer.**
2. **The faulting thread is not the pace thread.** All three records say `(other)`, which
   `thread_name()` returns only for a tid in no registered slot; `present` and `xr-pace`
   both register at entry. The faulter is a third-party worker (d3d11, driver, runtime).
   The pace thread can be the cause, but instrumenting it as the victim will find nothing.

**Two evidence channels were dead and are now fixed.**

- **`dumps\` was empty by construction.** 3 `EXCEPTION` lines, 0 `minidump` lines: proof
  that `unhandled()` never ran, because UE3's own filter/SEH frame consumes the fault
  before `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` fires. The dump is now taken from the **vectored**
  handler (which always runs), gated on the instruction pointer resolving to no loaded
  module - fatal-only by construction, and falsifiable: an ordinary in-module fault
  produces no dump and disproves the wild-EIP reading. `dbghelp.dll` is resolved at
  `install()` time so the VEH never touches the loader lock.
- **The crash file had no run identity.** `FILE_APPEND_DATA` / `OPEN_ALWAYS` with nothing
  separating runs, and `dvr-xrsim` and VDXR produce byte-identical fingerprint text, so
  the three records cannot be attributed to a backend at all. Now one header per run
  (clock, version, build id, pid, backend + runtime name).
- **Log rotation is one deep**, so two simulator runs erased both headset logs; the
  survivors contain no `EXCEPTION` and no `PreExit`. Copy the log out before each launch.

**The author read this fault correctly and session 2 inverted it.** The 38.79 comments say
"EIP dededede" and "a call through freed memory". 38.79 acted on that by standing the
**game** thread down at `PreExit`, which was right but not the whole path - it left the
pace thread running with nobody waiting for it. Closed below.

**Two pace-lane defects fixed** (steps 0b and 0c):

- **`XR_TIMEOUT_EXPIRED` is a success code.** `XrResult` is negative for failure only, so
  `XR_FAILED()` is false for it and `!XR_FAILED(xrWaitSwapchainImage(...))` ran
  `CopyResource` into an image the compositor had not finished reading - a race with the
  runtime on the one resource the headset displays, invisible because every call returns
  success. Now `== XR_SUCCESS`. In the same block `g_xrpShown` advanced **before** the
  copies, so a frame lost to a timeout was dropped permanently instead of retried; it now
  advances only once both eyes actually received the content.
- **`XrPaceStop()` joins the pace thread**, bounded at 750 ms, replacing the bare
  `g_xrRun = 0`. On expiry the thread is left running on purpose - `TerminateThread` would
  orphan `g_xrCs` and abandon an acquired swapchain image, which is worse than the race -
  and the error line is the instrument: a fault after it means the pace lane is still the
  suspect, a fault without it means the thread was already gone and it is not. The event
  pump's inner `while` now tests `g_xrRun` so an event backlog cannot hold the loop past a
  stop request.

**Changed** (8 files, uncommitted): `src/core/util/crash.cpp` and `crash.h` (three-valued
AV decode; run header; `set_context`; shared `write_dump` with the wild-EIP gate),
`src/core/vr/openxr_backend.cpp` (names the runtime in the crash context),
`src/core/vr/openxr_pace.cpp` (the wait fix, the retry fix, `XrPaceStop`),
`src/game/dishonored/ue3/process_event.cpp` (`PreExit` joins), `src/mod/fwd.h`,
`docs/dishonored/ENGINE_NOTES.md`, `docs/STATUS.md`. Verified: Debug, RelWithDebInfo and
`-Legacy` all build, and both DLLs carry the new strings; `lint.ps1` clean; exports 9/9
undecorated. **Not run in the game, in the simulator, or in a headset.**

**Next**: step 0a - the `CopyResource` size mismatch, which is still only a code-reading
hypothesis. Then the full `xrRequestExitSession` / `xrDestroySession` shutdown.

### 2026-09-02 - session 2: instrumentation, resolution, and a real headset

**First session with the game actually installed and a real Quest + Virtual Desktop
headset on the other end.** Environment: proxy and fork both built from source with
MSVC (meson + ninja + glslang 16.5.0 standalone, no Vulkan SDK); `tools\build-dxvk.ps1`
needed two fixes to run at all on a PC with VS 2026 installed next to VS 2022.

**Fixed and verified**

- **Resolution.** `ResX` in `DishonoredEngine.ini` never held: UE3 AppCompat picks an
  `[AppCompatBucketN]` at startup and writes that bucket's ResX/ResY over
  `[SystemSettings]`. Buckets 3 and 4 ship 1600x900, and any GPU newer than the 2012
  table lands in one, so every modern machine started at 1600x900 forever. Fix: set all
  four buckets; `tools\setup-game-ini.ps1 -Resolution` now does this and defaults to
  2750x2850. Measured before/after: `CreateDevice (1600x900)` -> `CreateDevice
  (2750x2850)`, `capture: 2750x2850` on the FIRST device creation, no setres needed.
- **`setres` is a dead end.** Measured `setres 2750x2850w -> "(empty reply)"` with NO
  device Reset following. New `[Screen] PinBackbuffer=1` (default OFF) sets the size in
  the present parameters at CreateDevice instead. The 32.57 "image in the corner"
  objection is answered by the GetClientRect hook that landed later.
- **World scale.** `W` is pinned to the rendered FOV and `H = W / frameAspect`, so a
  squarer render makes a taller virtual screen than the lenses can show and the player
  sees a magnified middle. 2750x2850 at FovLever=130 subtends 100x132 deg; at 100 it is
  100x102, which matches the headset. FovLever set to 100.
- **The mono/stereo UV race.** `BuildEyeQuads` BAKES the sampling UVs, but the rebuild
  only fired on an aspect change or a menu toggle. `g_sbsMonoNow` flips during gameplay
  whenever the fork's splice count dips, so a mono frame could be sampled with stereo
  UVs and each eye got a different half of one mono image. Now a change in frame kind
  forces a rebuild, exactly like the menu flag.

**Instrumentation added** (see the new "Logging" section in `CLAUDE.md`)

- Full DXGI adapter enumeration, the LUID the runtime asks for, and the adapter read
  back OUT of the finished device with an Error-level mismatch line.
- `RESOLUTION CHANGED MID-SESSION` at Warn, `quad: ... subtends AxB deg` per rebuild
  with a Warn past 110 deg vertical, `res: the game asked for WxH`, and a `skc/gate:`
  line for the hand drive.
- The hands heartbeat now names the OWNER and reports that owner's counter.

**Corrected beliefs** (all three were believed and are wrong)

1. "The hand graft never attaches." It attaches fine: `OWNER=SkelControl writes=~406/3s`
   in gameplay. The old heartbeat tracked two counters that read 0 BY DESIGN - one a
   retired subsystem, one the legacy drive that is deliberately stood down. Three
   readers including the original author concluded "the hands are dead" from a healthy
   run.
2. "The 39.3 adapter bug needs two GPUs." DXGI enumerates the SAME RTX 4070 Ti SUPER
   twice on this PC (virtual display drivers), so the default adapter is not stable on
   single-GPU machines either. **But on the real VDXR run the runtime asked for
   adapter[0], which IS the default, so the LUID mismatch is NOT the cause of the
   symptoms on this rig.** 40.1 still fixes the class of bug and makes it visible.
3. "The eyes are not a stereo pair." Measured 32.7 mean-abs-diff when static, but 11.5
   after a head turn, which is normal parallax. Stereo works; the divergence is a
   symptom of the freeze, not the disease.

**Still broken: the freeze-then-rescale.** Reported again after all of the above. What
is ruled out: the resolution (it now stays 2750x2850), the adapter (matched), the FOV
(100), the mono/stereo UV race (fixed), and the hand drive (working). What is NOT ruled
out and is where to look next:

- The **shutdown crash is a teardown race** and may share a root with the freeze: three
  runs ended with `EXCEPTION 0xc0000005 writing 0xDEDEDEDE` inside `d3d11.dll`, two
  threads at once, immediately after `PreExit` stops the pace thread. 0xDEDEDEDE is
  freed-memory poison. The detached pace thread is touching released D3D11 objects.
- The pace thread owns every runtime call while the game thread owns capture and
  UpdateSubresource on the SAME `g_ctx11`; ID3D11DeviceContext is NOT thread-safe.
  `ID3D10Multithread` is enabled but that protects the device, not a stale pointer.
- Instrument the frame path next: log around the Reset/teardown boundary and around
  every `g_ctx11` use from the pace lane, and get a minidump analysed from
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DishonoredVR\dumps`.

### 2026-09-02 - session 1: development framework

Explored the 22,959-line `src/dllmain.cpp` and the BioShock trilogy mod; planned the refactor
with the user (decisions: CMake+MSVC; DXVK restored in-repo and kept as the stereo path; both
backends kept behind one pipeline; retired code to `src/legacy`; a proper logging/debugging
surface). Executed: DXVK restore (52 patch commits + the M8.4 revert; `fork-patches/` removed),
submodules and vendored OpenVR, CMake scaffold and MSVC port (naked stubs, `.def`,
`_ReturnAddress`, `ID3D10Multithread`), the unity split, Phase 2 utilities, harness copy and
adaptation, simulator build + selftest PASS, debug surface, patterns.h, legacy gating, backend
probe, docs. Found: `dxvk_vr_view` is resolved by the proxy but absent from the published
patches (the handoff confirms it is the unshipped p53 commit); the hand-skin `.mtl` path used
`\v` and `\%` escapes so materials never loaded (fixed); 165 em dashes swept. Received the
author's handoff (their build 39.4) at the end of the session: version renumbered to 40.0.0,
the 39.x fixes and the adapter hypothesis folded into ROADMAP, KNOWN_ISSUES, CODE_REVIEW,
ENGINE_NOTES and XR_HANDOFF. Verification: exports 9/9, lint clean, both legacy
configurations build, `split-source.py --check` reports only the intended changes. Branch
pushed.
